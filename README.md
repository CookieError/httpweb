httpweb.py
============

>httpweb.py is a small script that tests the speed of a http request and response with different user-agents. The use gives the script two paths, one to a list of website addresses to test and the other a list of user-agents to uses.

How to use
===========

>You need to have two text files, one for the web addresses that you want to connect too. The second one must have the user-agent you want to you. if you have more than one web address and user-agent it will just loop through and test them all.

>If you uses the ````-s```` flag you will get the results to show at the end. by the way you can uses the ````-o```` flag to pass a path where you want the results to be save.

>If you do not pass the ````-s```` or ````-o```` flag you can go to your home directory and then ````cd .mulvie/httpweb```` and the output.txt file will be there to view.

>Also in the ```` .mulvie/httpweb```` directory you will find the log file if something goes wrong
